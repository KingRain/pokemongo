      Pokémon, electronic game series from Nintendo that debuted in Japan in
      February 1996 as Pokémon Green and Pokémon Red. The franchise later became
      wildly popular in the United States and around the world. The series,
      originally produced for the company’s Game Boy line of handheld consoles,
      was introduced in 1998 to the United States with two titles, known to fans
      as Red and Blue. In the games, players assume the role of Pokémon
      trainers, obtaining cartoon monsters and developing them to battle other
      Pokémon. Pokémon became one of the most successful video game franchises
      in the world, second only to Nintendo’s Super Mario Bros.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original Pokémon is a role-playing game based around building a small
      team of monsters to battle other monsters in a quest to become the best.
      Pokémon are divided into types, such as water and fire, each with
      different strengths. Battles between them can be likened to the simple
      hand game rock-paper-scissors. For example, to gain an advantage over a
      Pokémon that cannot beat an opponent’s Charizard character because of a
      weakness to fire, a player might substitute a water-based Pokémon. With
      experience, Pokémon grow stronger, gaining new abilities. By defeating Gym
      Leaders and obtaining Gym Badges, trainers garner acclaim. Pikachu, a
      yellow mouselike creature, is the undisputed face of Pokémon and helped
      the series become a worldwide phenomenon. Pokémon inspired a cartoon
      series, movies, books, a toy line, sequels, spin-offs, a clothing line,
      and a popular trading-card game. In spite of a friendly interface and
      little violence, Pokémon has not been without controversy, however. In
      1999 the parents of two nine-year-old boys sued Nintendo, stating that the
      Pokémon card game had caused the children to develop gambling problems and
      likening the trading-card craze to an illegal lottery. Religious groups
      that discount the theory of evolution also targeted Pokémon, for showing
      Pokémon evolving into new creatures. Beginning in 2006, Pokémon video-game
      titles were produced exclusively for a new handheld console, the Nintendo
      DS, instead of the Game Boy, which was soon discontinued. In 2013 Pokémon
      X and Pokémon Y debuted on the Nintendo 3DS, which employed stereoscopic
      technology. The mobile application Pokémon GO was a blockbuster success
      upon its release in 2016. Developed by Niantic Labs, a former division of
      Google, the game used GPS data and the mobile device’s camera to create an
      “augmented reality” that allowed users to capture Pokémon from real-life
      locations.

      The name Pokémon actually means "pocket monsters" Pikachu, the most
      popular Pokémon and my personal favorite, is an electric Pokémon with
      special attacks such as "Thundershock" and "Lightningbolt." Other Pokémon
      and their attacks include Krabby, a water Pokémon, with a "vise grip"
      attack; Tauros a normal type Pokémon with a "tail whip" attack; and
      Squirtle, also a water type Pokémon, with a "hydro pump" attack . Pokémon
      started as the brainchild of Japanese creator Satoshi Tajiri, 34, who
      combined his two childhood passions: monster movies and the study of
      insects to invent Pokémon in 1991" ("Poka" 2/3). There are over 155
      Pokémon to learn about and collect. There are Pokémon trading cards, video
      games (several different versions), and a cartoon series on the Kids’ WB
      television network.

      Pokemon means Pocket Monster.It used to come in cartoon network at 5 o
      clock in the evening.Ash and Pikachu are the main characters of this show.
      Pikachu is the most famous pokemon. He is very cute and he is also Ash's
      ,his masters best friend. The bond between Ash and Pikachu is great.
